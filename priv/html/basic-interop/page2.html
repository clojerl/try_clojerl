Great! As you can see each process has its own ID and this function let's
you find out what that is.

In the call to the function "erlang/self", the first part ("erlang") is the module where the function is defined and the second ("self") the name of the function.

If you already know Erlang then it's useful to know that the colon (":") separator is replaced by the slash ("/") in Clojerl.

Let's now print something to the screen by using "io/format" and providing some arguments:

    (io/format "Hello Universe!\n")
